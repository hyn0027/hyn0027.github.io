      Seeking Participants for an Interview Study on ML-Powered System
      Safeguards
    </h1>

    <p>
      We are researchers from Carnegie Mellon University conducting interviews
      to better understand how practitioners manage risks in systems that
      include machine learning components. During the interview, we will
      discuss:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A system we’ve developed</li>
      <li>A system you've worked on that includes ML components</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>18 years or older</li>
      <li>
        Experience working on software or applications with ML models and able
        to discuss that experience
        <br />
        <small
          ><i
            >No experience in safeguards or risk management is required.</i
          ></small
        >
        <br />
        <small
          ><i

        Contribute to research on improving the safety and security of
        ML-powered systems
      </li>
      <li>Gain insights into practical safeguards for ML applications</li>
      <li>Reflect on your own approaches to risk mitigation</li>
      <li>Learn about emerging safeguarding methods in ML</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
