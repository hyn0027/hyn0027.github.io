      Seeking Participants for an Interview Study on ML-Powered System
      Safeguards
    </h1>

    <p>
      We are conducting an interview study to explore how practitioners approach
      safeguards for risks in ML-powered systems. This is part of a research
      study. Participants will discuss safeguards in (1) an ML-powered system we
      have built and (2) an ML-powered system they have worked on.
    </p>

    <h2>Who can participate?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>18 years or older</li>
      <li>
        Have experience working on ML-powered systems and willing to discuss
        your experience during the interview<br />
        <small
          ><i
            >(No confidential information will be requested during the
            interview)</i
          ></small
        >
      </li>
      <li>Capable of coding in Python</li>
      <li>Communicate in English</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Compensation</h2>
    <p>
      Each participant will receive a $30 USD Amazon gift card after completing
      the study.
    </p>

    <h2>Procedures</h2>
    <p>
      If you decide to participate, you will complete a sign-up survey below
      (approximately 5 minutes to finish) to sign the consent form and collect
      information we will be discussing in the interview. For the interview, we
      will set up a time (a 60-90 minute slot) at your convenience. The study
      would be audio and screen recorded to compile accurate information about
      how you perform the task. We will not record any video of you. Anything
      you tell us will be confidential and we will not release any information
      without de-identifying the data.
