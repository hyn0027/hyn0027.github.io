## TL;DR

Weâ€™re CMU researchers studying how engineers manage risks in software/applications with ML components. If you code in Python and have worked on any parts of a software/application with ML model as components, weâ€™d love to interview you! Youâ€™ll get a $30 Amazon gift card for your time.

Weâ€™re researchers at Carnegie Mellon University studying how practitioners manage risks in software systems or applications with machine learning (ML) components. **Weâ€™d love to hear about and learn from your valuable experiences in a one-on-one interview.**

## What to Expect

1. **Sign-Up Survey** (â‰ˆ 5 minutes): Includes a consent form and questions about your background.
2. **Interview Session** (60â€“90 minutes via Zoom):
   - Share your thoughts on risks in:
     - A system we've developed
     - A system you've worked on with ML components
   - Audio and screen (not video) will be recorded
   - Your responses will be kept confidential and anonymized
