I am a first year PhD student at [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/), [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

Before joining CMU, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/) and B.Ec. in Economics and Finance at the [School of Economics and Management](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Maosong Sun](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ) and Prof. [Junliang Xing](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/jlxing/en/).

I also undertook a summer research internship at CMU's [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/), co-advised by Prof. [Christian Kästner](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/) and Prof. [Sherry Tongshuang Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/).

<!-- # Research & Industry Experience
I served as an undergraduate research assistant at [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Prof. [Maosong Sun](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ). My work primarily focused on graph-to-text generation.

I also undertook a summer research internship at CMU's [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/), working under the joint guidance of Prof. [Christian Kästner](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/) and Prof. [Sherry Tongshuang Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/). Here I conducted research on LLM-enabled automated data slicing, a vital aspect of SE4AI.

Currently, I am a part-time software engineer intern at [Megvii](https://en.megvii.com/), a leading Chinese AI-software company. I work with both data scientists and software engineers to develop autonomous driving systems with complex integrated AI components. My objective in this internship is to further deepen my understanding how people build AI-integrated software and the existing problems in this process. -->

# Teaching Experience
I was a volunteer teaching assistant at the [Center for Student Learning and Development](https://learning.tsinghua.edu.cn/zxgk/ywjs.htm) at Tsinghua University, an association that offers drop-in tutoring for STEM courses. I assisted students with computer science courses including data structures & algorithms and object-oriented programmings.
