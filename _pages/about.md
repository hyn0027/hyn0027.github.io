I am a junior undergraduate student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), enrolled in a dual-degree program in both **computer science** through the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/) and **finance** via the  [School of Economics and Management](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

I served as an undergraduate research assistant at [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Prof. [Maosong Sun](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ). My work primarily focused on graph-to-text generation.

I also undertook a summer research internship at CMU's [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/), working under the joint guidance of Prof. [Christian KÃ¤stner](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/) and Prof. [Sherry Tongshuang Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/). Here I conducted research on LLM-enabled automated data slicing, a vital aspect of SE4AI.

Currently, I am a part-time software engineer intern at [Megvii](https://en.megvii.com/), a leading Chinese AI-software company. I work with both data scientists and software engineers to develop autonomous driving systems with complex integrated AI components. My objective in this internship is to further deepen my understanding of SE4AI.

# Teaching Experience
I am a volunteer teaching assistant (outstanding level) at the [Center for Student Learning and Development](https://learning.tsinghua.edu.cn/zxgk/ywjs.htm) at Tsinghua University, an association that offers drop-in tutoring for STEM courses. I assist students with computer science courses including data structures & algorithms and object-oriented programmings.
